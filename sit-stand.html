      <h2>Sit-Stand Desks</h2>
        <p>
          Sit-Stand Desks have become a popular topic over the last decade, spurring conversation and controversy. Too much of anything can become a bad thing. Similarly, a great idea used wrong can become detrimental. Sit-stand desks are a great tool to utilize to facilitate movement and increased blood flow throughout the day and research has suggested it can increase user productivity. Although, attempting to stand all day long will more than likely lead to avoidable overuse and strain of the back, hips, and legs.
          <br>
          <br>
          Standing is a static position, creating many isometric contractions in various muscles throughout your body. Static contractions can quickly lead to general muscular fatigue and can begin to shift posture and positioning. Attempting to stand for hours on end will more than likely lead to “lazy standing”, leaning, or weight-bearing through your elbows, wrists, or hands creating hazardous conditions to those regions of the body.
          <br>
          <br>
          Alternating, standing for transitional breaks is great and should be done in moderation. <strong>A general recommendation is to stand, if able, for 10-20 minutes every hour as tolerated.</strong> This change in position creates the opportunity for the various muscles of the body to stretch and decrease potentially developing muscular stiffness, strain, or nerve tension while remaining focused on your work. Every job and every worker is different, requiring different provisions. What is most important is to be personally aware of the developing fatigue, tension, or strain developing through your body while you continue to stay engaged in your work.

      <h2>Brief Equipment Guide</h2>
        <p>
          There are many workstation variations which promote the sit-stand mentality, ranging from fully adjustable desks to wall mounted workstations. All have their own place for different workers. For example, a graphic designer would benefit most from a fully adjustable desk so the full work station rises with them. This decreases the need to reach or grab objects which have not raised with them and allow ample room to use open space for drawing, writing, ect. A physician may only require an adjustable monitor and keyboard if they strictly mouse and key into patients’ charts - not entailing additional equipment or surface area.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A few specific thoughts to consider when selecting your sit-stand option:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you need additional work space apart from a monitor, keyboard, and mouse?</li>
            <li>What kind of budget do you have available?</li>
            <li>Does the new workstation allow for the keyboard and mouse to stay at the same height while
              seated and standing (recommended)?</li>
            <li>Do you need the whole workstation to lift, or just the computer equipment for intermittent
              breaks?</li>
            <li>Do you want a new desk or something to be added to your current desk?</li>
            <li>Will the new desk require additional equipment to maintain good ergonomics (monitor height,
              chair adjustability, and arm positioning)?</li>
            <li>What will fit if your current office space?</li>
          </ul>
          These thought-provoking questions should guide you to select what equipment will work best for you. If you have any further questions regarding sit-stand desks or general ergonomics, feel free to reach out to rootergonomics.com.
