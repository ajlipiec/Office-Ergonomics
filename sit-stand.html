      <h1>Stay tuned for more content. But to start, here are some things to consider while choosing a sit-stand desk or workstation.</h1>
      <h2>Sit-Stand Desks</h2>
        <p>
          Sit-Stand Desks have become a popular topic over the last decade, spurring conversation and controversy. Too much of anything can become a bad thing. There is inconsistent research supporting the use of sit-stand workstations. Some research suggests these desks can improve focus and productivity while others show increased lower extremity pain and fatigue. There are even inconsistent parameters for the specific durations and ratios to sit and stand. Everyone is different and has different work needs. If you use a sit-stand desk or plan to, it's important to temper your daily habits to your personal ability level. Standing for too long for some can lead to similar musculoskeletal fatigue and breakdown found in the seated worker. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Standing is a static position, creating many isometric contractions in various muscles throughout your body. Static contractions can quickly lead to general muscular fatigue and can begin to negatively shift posture and positioning. Attempting to stand for hours on end will more than likely lead to “lazy standing”, leaning, or weight-bearing through your elbows, wrists, or hands. This can quickly and unintentionally create hazardous conditions for those regions of the body.
          <br>
          <br>
          Alternately, standing for transitional breaks is a great user mentality and should be done in moderation. <strong>A general recommendation is to stand, if able, for 10-20 minutes every hour as tolerated.</strong> This change in position creates the opportunity for the various muscles of the body to stretch and decrease relevant muscular stiffness, strain, or nerve tension while remaining focused on your work. Every job and every worker is different, requiring different provisions. What is most important is to be personally aware of the fatigue, tension, or strain developing through your body while you continue to stay engaged in your work. Then you are more able to make responsible decisions based on how your body is tolerating a changing environment. Sit-stand desks are a tool that may facilitate movement and increased blood flow throughout the day but should be used thoughtfully. It is also important to consider what different desks can offer you so that your needs may be more perfectly met.

      <h2>Brief Equipment Guide</h2>
        <p>
          There are many workstation variations that promote the sit-stand mentality, ranging from fully adjustable desks to wall-mounted workstations. All have their own place for different workers. For example, a graphic designer would benefit from a work station which rises in its entirety as opposed to just the computer and keyboard tray. This decreases the need to reach or grab objects which have not been raised with them and allow ample room to use open space for drawing, writing, etc.  Alternatively, and administrative assistant may only require an adjustable monitor and keyboard if they are primarily dependent on the computer for their work - not requiring additional equipment or surface area. It's further important to consider what your body is able to tolerate. Some desks require a degree of force to manually pull / push it to the correct height while others are fully electric. Consider some of the following questions to ask yourself:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Thoughts to consider when selecting your sit-stand desk or workstation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you need additional work space apart from a monitor, keyboard, and mouse?</li>
            <li>What kind of budget do you have available?</li>
            <li>Does the new workstation allow for keyboard and mouse adjustability when working at different heights?</li>
            <li>Do you need the whole workstation to lift or just the computer + keyboard/ mouse for intermittent
              breaks?</li>
            <li>Do you want a fully new desk or something to be added to your current workstation?</li>
            <li>Will the new desk require additional equipment to maintain adequate adjustability for good ergonomics (Monitor stand, keyboard tray, etc)?</li>
            <li>What will fit in your current office space?</li>
            <li>Do you have any current injuries or pains which prevent you from manually adjusting your desk?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          These thought-provoking questions should help guide you to select what equipment will work best for you. If you have any further questions regarding sit-stand desks or general ergonomics, feel free to reach out to Root Ergonomics.

      <h2>Equipment Examples and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>As with all equipment, sit-stand desks run on a spectrum and ranges dependent on your needs and budget.

        <h2>FEZIBO Adjustable Electric Desk</h2>

        <h2>Defy Convertible Standing Riser Table</h2>
          <p>37.4” x 24.2”</p>
          <p>For the causal office worker who is dependent primarily on computer use and has little need for excessive table space. This unit rests on an already established desk. The keyboard and mouse rise with the monitor platform, negating the need to adjust ergonomics before and after the transition. Although the keyboard/mouse platform has minimal height adjustability apart from the full unit so this product would pair best with a height-adjustable chair to ensure perfect ergonomic positioning while seated.</p>

It has a sturdy design for the price with minimal shaking while typing. As with the Defy Convertible Standing Riser Table, this unit would be well paired with an adjustable chair to ensure proper keyboard height while seated.
