      <h1>A Time to Stand Up</h1>
      <h2> Section 1: Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Sit-Stand Desks have become a popular topic over the last decade, spurring conversation and controversy. There is inconsistent research supporting the use of sit-stand workstations. Some studies suggest these desks can improve focus and productivity while others show increased lower extremity pain and fatigue. There are even inconsistent parameters for the specific durations to sit and stand throughout a workday. The most important consideration is that everyone is different and has different work needs. If you use a sit-stand desk or plan to, it's important to temper your daily habits within the range of your abilities. Standing for too long for some can lead to similar musculoskeletal fatigue and breakdown found in the seated worker. When used correctly, sit-stand desks can appropriately increase your work endurance, focus, and decrease the many aches and pain related to being seated for 8-hours a day or more.
          <br>
          <br>
          Standing is a static position, creating many isometric contractions in various muscles throughout your body. An isometric contraction is stationary activation of the muscles without the allowance of joint movement. Static contractions can quickly lead to general muscular fatigue and can begin to negatively shift posture and positioning. Movement is one of the body's natural mechanisms to shift swelling and supply oxygen to the muscles during continuous use. While the muscles fatigue, isometric contractions can cause the joints of the spine, hips, and knees to become strained. Without stability granted from your muscles, the forces shift to the joints as the last line of defense to contain the effects of gravity. Further, attempting to stand for long hours will more than likely lead to loading weight through your elbows, wrists, or hands. This can quickly and unintentionally create hazardous conditions for those regions of the body like tendonitis, or nerve-related pain through the arms, wrists, and hands.
          <br>
          <br>
          Alternately, standing for transitional breaks can be helpful to increase blood flow and prevent many forms of musculoskeletal pain, but should be done in moderation. <strong>A general recommendation is to stand, if able, for 10-20 minutes every hour as tolerated.</strong> This change in position creates the opportunity for the various muscles of the body to stretch, recieve increased circulation, and decrease relevant muscular stiffness, strain, or nerve tension while remaining focused on your work. Many users can stand for much longer with success, but it is important to consider that every job and every worker is different, requiring unique provisions. What is most important is to be personally aware of the fatigue, tension, or strain that develops through your body while you continue to stay engaged in your work. Then you are more able to make responsible decisions based on how your body is tolerating the changing environment. Sit-stand desks are a tool that may facilitate movement and increased blood flow throughout the day but should be used thoughtfully. Sit-stand desks consist of many different properties and features. Consider what aspects are required for your job and body type so that your desk can be matched to you as an individual and your needs will be perfectly met.

      <h2>Section 2: Brief Equipment Guide</h2>
        <p>
          Many workstation variations promote the sit-stand mentality, ranging from fully adjustable desks to table-top workstations. All have their place for different workers. For example, a graphic designer would benefit from a work station which rises in its entirety as opposed to just the computer and keyboard tray. This decreases the need to repetatively reach for items which have not been also raised and allows ample space for drawing, writing, etc. Alternatively, an administrative assistant may only require an adjustable monitor and keyboard if they are primarily dependent on the computer for their work - not requiring additional equipment or surface area. It's also important to know what your body can tolerate. Some desks require a degree of force to manually pull / push / crank to the correct height while others are fully electric. Consider some of the following questions to ask yourself:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Thoughts to consider when selecting your sit-stand desk or workstation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you need additional work space apart from a monitor, keyboard, and mouse?</li>
            <li>What kind of budget do you have available?</li>
            <li>Does the new workstation allow for keyboard and mouse adjustability when working at different heights?</li>
            <li>Do you need the whole workstation to lift or just the computer + keyboard / mouse for intermittent
              breaks?</li>
            <li>Do you want a fully new desk or something to be added to your current workstation?</li>
            <li>Will the new desk require additional equipment to maintain adequate adjustability for good ergonomics (Monitor stand, keyboard tray, etc)?</li>
            <li>What will fit in your current office space?</li>
            <li>Do you have any current injuries or pains which prevent you from manually adjusting your desk?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          These questions should help guide you to select what equipment will work best for you. If you have any further questions regarding sit-stand desks or general ergonomics, feel free to reach out to Root Ergonomics.

      <h2>Section 3: Examples and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>As with all equipment, sit-stand desks can be arranged on a spectrum and their usefulness is dependent on your needs and budget. The following are examples depicting the differences you may need or want for your specific workstation. Although these products are recommended through personal and past client experience, please conduct your research and find which item fits best with your particular needs.</p>

        <h2>Flexispot Standing Desk: Basic</h2>
          <p>48” x 30”</p>
          <p>This a great option for transitioning to a brand new desk. The large desk area is ideal for work requiring multiple monitors or roles encompassing artistic design (drawing, writing, creating). This desk raises electronically but does not have a memory to store your preferred heights, requiring thoughtful adjustment with each use. A desk like this would further benefit from a mounted keyboard tray due to modify the height and tilt, ensuring proper ergonomics and arm positioning.</p>

        <h2>FEZIBO Adjustable Electric Desk</h2>
          <p>48” x 24”</p>
          <p>Similar to the Flexisport Standing Desk, this unit is large and sturdy with easy assembly. The desk space rises with you making it unnecessary to reorganize your space for typing, mousing, or writing tasks. The slight price increase is found in its memory, storing multiple heights for a quick and accessible transition from sit-to-stand consistently.</p>

    <div class="productLong">
        <h2>DEVAISE Adjustable Desk: Hand Crank</h2>
          <p>55.1” x 23.6”</p>
          <p>A slightly more affordable option with a manual crank to be fitted to either side of the desk adjust to the space you have. The manual crank is great for those who distrust the longevity of motorized desks and prefer to do things the old-fashioned way. This desk is slimmer and longer, providing adequate space for jobs requiring heavy computer use with side-by-side monitors such as programming or finance. Consider also using a mountable/ clamping keyboard and mouse tray to fully utilize the desk space and have complete adjustability when transitioning from sit-stand.</p>

        <h2>ApexDesk Elite Series Electric</h2>
          <p>60” x 29.5”</p>
          <p>This behemoth of a sit-stand desk provides absolute space to complete daily office tasks. Crafted with steel and engineered wood, this unit combines efficiency with style. It is fully electric with programable memory and contoured front edging, allowing the user to sit closer for focused and engaged work. Beware the temptation of using a desk this size. You may find yourself using its surface to bear weight through your hands and wrists or lean on the desk if standing for too long.</p>

        <h2>Defy Convertible Standing Riser Table</h2>
          <p>37.4” x 24.2”</p>
          <p>For the casual office worker who is primarily dependent on computer use and has little need for excessive table space. This unit rests on an already established desk or table. The keyboard and mouse rise with the monitor platform, decreasing the need to adjust positioning before and after the transition from sit to stand. Although, the keyboard/mouse platform has minimal adjustability apart from the full unit so this product would pair best with a height-adjustable chair to ensure perfect ergonomic positioning while seated.</p>
          <p>$159.99</p>

        <h2>FlexiSpot 28” Standing Desk Converter</h2>
          <p>28.3”x 16.3”</p>
          <p>This unit is a very efficient and affordable sit-stand transition surface. The keyboard tray is set at a consistent level but the whole platform is removable if desired. It has a sturdy design for the price with minimal shaking while typing. As with the Defy Convertible Standing Riser Table, this unit would be well paired with an adjustable chair to ensure proper keyboard height while seated. Be sure to measure your desk’s depth before purchase as the product is deeper than maybe visually anticipated.</p>
