      <h2>Consultation for the Individual</h2>
        <p>Root Ergonomics can adapt to the needs of the client. We offer both on-site evaluations, either at your place of work or home office AND virtual assessments completed via video, phone, and email interface. An assessment is individualized for each client's specific needs and may consist of the following components:
          <ul>
            <li>Formal ergonomic assessment and evaluation </li>
            <li>Assessment of habits during daily work with activity analysis</li>
            <li>Recommendation of products and equipment to relieve ergonomic deficiencies</li>
            <li>Education and demonstration to provide stretches, basic exercises, and strategies to prevent work-related injuries as applicable</li>
            <li>Make recommendations to alleviate developing or ongoing pain related to poor ergonomics</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Virtual Remote</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is an effective approach to complete a full ergonomic assessment while relying on video interface. We will send you a template to take some measurements and brief activity to be video recorded by a friend or family member for analysis. We will follow-up after we are able to complete the analysis using a video interface to discuss the results and potential recommendations. We still have the ability to discuss developing pains and injuries and make the appropriate recommendations or referrals. Appointment time will take between 45 minutes - 1 hour.</p>

        <h2>On-Site Consultation</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is specifically serviced to the Portland, Oregon greater metro area. If selected, we would come to your home or office and complete the assessment in person. This option is typically the most effective as we can take physical measurements, arrange equipment, and make adjustments in the moment. If you are experiencing developing pain from your work, this allows us to make the most specific recommendations for stretches and/or exercises. The appointment takes approximately 1-hour to 1.5-hours.</p>
