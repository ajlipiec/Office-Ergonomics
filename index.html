      <h2>Personalized Consultation for each Individual</h2>
        <p>Root Ergonomics can adapt to the needs of the client. We offer both on-site evaluations, either at your place of work or home office AND virtual assessments completed via video, phone, and email interface. An assessment is individualized for each client's specific needs and may consist of the following components:
          <ul>
            <li>Formal ergonomic assessment and evaluation </li>
            <li>Assessment of habits during daily work with activity analysis</li>
            <li>Recommendation of products and equipment to relieve ergonomic deficiencies</li>
            <li>Education and demonstration to provide stretches, basic exercises, and strategies to prevent work-related injuries as applicable</li>
            <li>Make recommendations to alleviate developing or ongoing pain related to poor ergonomics</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>On-Site Consultation</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is specifically serves Portland, Oregon and surrounding areas. If selected, we would come to your home or office and complete the assessment in person. With this option, we take physical measurements, arrange equipment, and make adjustments in the moment. If you are experiencing developing pain from your work, this allows us to make the most specific recommendations through hands on assessment for stretches and/or exercises. The appointment takes approximately 1-hour to 1.5-hours.</p>

        <h2>Virtual Consultation</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is an effective approach to complete a full ergonomic assessment while relying on video interface. You will take measurements and complete a brief stint of work to be photographed and video recorded by a friend or family member for analysis. We will follow-up for a formal debrief session via video interface (Zoom) to discuss the results and provide relevant education, visual guides, and recommendations while discussing developing pains and injuries you may be experiencing. Appointment time will take between 45 minutes - 1 hour.</p>
