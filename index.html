      <h2>About Root Ergonomics</h2>
        <p>Root Ergonomics conducts ergonomic evaluations for both work and home offices. Root Ergonomics is owned and operated by Andrew Lipiec out of Portland, OR. He has a Doctorate in Occupational Therapy (OTD) and is certified as an Advanced Office Ergonomics Assessment Specialist (AOEAS). Andrew has worked several years in outpatient rehabilitation, specifically treating patients experiencing upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other repetitive strain injuries - many of which were due to poor work ergonomics. He has been inspired to reach out to individuals and decrease the heavy risk of life-altering injuries by working to prevent these breakdowns at the source, providing individuals with the opportunity to perfect their daily work.</p>

      <h2>Personalized Consultation for each Individual</h2>
        <p>Root Ergonomics can adapt to the needs of the client. We offer both on-site evaluations, either at your place of work or home office AND virtual assessments completed via video, phone, and email interface. An assessment is individualized for each client's specific needs and may consist of the following components:
          <ul>
            <li>Formal ergonomic assessment and evaluation </li>
            <li>Assessment of habits during daily work with activity analysis</li>
            <li>Recommendation of products and equipment to relieve ergonomic deficiencies</li>
            <li>Education and demonstration to provide stretches, basic exercises, and strategies to prevent work-related injuries as applicable</li>
            <li>Make recommendations to alleviate developing or ongoing pain related to poor ergonomics</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>On-Site Consultation</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is specifically serviced to the Portland, Oregon and surrounding areas. If selected, we would come to your home or office and complete the assessment in person. This option is typically the most effective as we can take physical measurements, arrange equipment, and make adjustments in the moment. If you are experiencing developing pain from your work, this allows us to make the most specific recommendations through hands on assessment for stretches and/or exercises. The appointment takes approximately 1-hour to 1.5-hours.</p>

        <h2>Virtual Consultation</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is an effective approach to complete a full ergonomic assessment while relying on video interface. We will send you a template to take some measurements and brief activity to be video recorded by a friend or family member for analysis. We will follow-up after we complete the analysis using a video interface (Zoom) to discuss the results and potential recommendations. We still have the ability to discuss developing pains and injuries and make the appropriate recommendations or referrals. Appointment time will take between 45 minutes - 1 hour.</p>
