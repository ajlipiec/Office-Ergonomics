        Due to Covid-19, many individuals have been sent home to work remotely. In many cases, these individuals are equipped with inadequate office equipment and are highly prone to developing various repetative strain injuries (RSI) and other other musculoskeletal breaks downs like tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. <strong>Having the correct posture, positioning, and placement of equipment</strong> can prevent and potentially fix developing breakdowns occuring during office work activties.
