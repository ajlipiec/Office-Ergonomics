          <li>Assessment of habits during daily work with activity analysis</li>
          <li>Reccomendation of products and equipment to relieve ergonomic deficiencies</li>
          <li>Education and demonstration to provide stretches, basic exericses, and strategies to prevent work-related injuries as applicable</li>

      <h2>On Site (Home or Office)</h2>
        <p>
          During this type of evaluation, I would come to your home office and complete the assessment in person. This option is typically the most effective as we can take physical measurements, arrange equipment, and make adjustments in person. If you are experiencing developing pain from your work, this allows us to make the most specific reccomendations for stretches and/or exercises. The appointment takes approximately 1-hour to 1.5-hours.</p>

      <h2>Video Remote</h2>
        <p>
          This evaluation is an effective appraoch to complete a full ergonomic assessment while relying on video interface. We will send you a template to take some measurements and and brief activity to be video recorded for analysis. We will follow-up after we are able to complete the analysis using a video interface to discuss the results and potential reccomendations. We still have the ability to discuss developing pains and injuries and make the appropriate reccomendations or refferals. Appointment time will take between 45 minutes - 1 hour.</p>
